                    Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications.
                    It includes front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development with server-side languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and Node.js, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB.
                    Full-stack development covers both areas.
                    It also involves web design (UI/UX), deployment and hosting (AWS, Google Cloud), version control (Git), and web security.
